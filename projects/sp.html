  <p><i>–––&nbsp;&nbsp;identity</i></p>
  <p>Starting from research the area, the goal of this project is creating an identity for the neighborhood of choice. The entire project includes creating a logomark, an icon set and a map. I chose South Park without much knowledge of the place, though it turns to be a fun area to explore.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Before going to the libraries and read about the place, I visited South Park on a weekend morning. I was surprised to find out the park is under construction and won’t be open till next year. Therefore I focused on the community rather than the park.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>South Park neighborhood has a diverse community, from businesses and studios to apartments and salons. This map shows the variety of buildings in the neighborhood. Each color refers to a specific usage of the buildings. Opacity is used to indicate
      the year the building is built. I collected data from both online database and direct observation.</p>

    <p>The neighborhood consists of four similarly-shaped blocks surrounding the oval-shaped park. This infographic focus on comparing data and information of different building usage in each block, emphasizing how the distribution varies in four quarters.</p>
