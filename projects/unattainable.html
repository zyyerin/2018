  <p><strong>Unattainable</strong> is designed as a series of booklets discuss the relationship between human biases and current technologies. Topic of this issue is narrative bias and information seeking on the internet.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <div class="pParagraph hero">
    <p>This project was developed from a series of smaller assignments, including a chart/table, a diagram, and a map. Throughout the semester, I was struggling to figure out a way to clarify my interest in the randomness. With these assignments, I am able to create a narrative that articulates my thinking of information seeking on the web.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>For each assignment, I collected data on the internet and organize them with Spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>Using Illustrator, I created the chart and diagram. For the map, I used Sketch and InVision to prototype an application that forces the user to focus on one location and realize the randomness behind everything, particularly major disasters we think we can predict and learn from.</p>

  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

    <h3>Format</h3>
    <p>The beginning of the final delivery is a web plug-in designed to enable people seeing larger scope while searching, compare to going from point to point and eventually get lost in info. After doing some research on web-navigation and information architecture, I realized it’s impossible to make such a product in this amount of time, even just the prototype. Thus I went to another direction: trying my best to articulate my point and get people to think about the situation.</p>

  <div class="pParagraph">
    <h3>More Research</h3>
    <p>Though people suggested me creating a website, I made up my mind to use a traditional medium after I found out that the average time people spend on a webpage is fewer than 15 or 10 seconds (which seems quite resonable when I reflected on my own browsing behaviors).</p>

    <h3>Narrative</h3>
    <p>The booklet is self-explanatory. I quoted an entire chapter from the book, <i>The Black Swan</i> by N.N.Taleb, as the main argument, along with my own writings. The booklet is supposed to be a guide for the reader rather than an information source.</p>

    <h3>Iteration</h3>
    <p>The affordability is one of the main concern in this project. Thanks to that, I was able to make copies easily so that I could give out to people for feedback. Above is an interesting moment that I got a comment from my roommate, saying things that I am critiquing, and I kept that in the final version of the booklet. </p>
  </div>

   <div class="pParagraph">
    <h3>Circulation</h3>
    <p>In the end, I made 10 copies and gave it out to people. Ideally, I could get some thoughts from them, and the booklets would be passed to others. In reality, I haven’t got any formal comments yet (some of my friends resist to write on books). </p>

    <h3>Next Step</h3>
    <p>As I stated at the beginning, this is one booklet from the series. I would explore other forms for the next issue, which is about persuasion through data.</p>
