  <h1>PastFuture Cafe >>>>>> </h1>
  <p><i>–––&nbsp;&nbsp;identity</i></p>
  <p><strong>PastFuture Cafe</strong> serves as a critique on current usage of big data for decision making. Its name comes from an essay, Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies, by Martin Hilbert: the decisions based on the analysis
    of big data are inevitably <i>informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is.</i> It aims at raising customers’ awareness of the danger of big data through the experience at the cafe.</p>
  <p>Notice this project focus on the visual aspect of the cafe, rather than the entire service. Also, I used an analog approach for this project, drawing and making with hand instead of getting things done digitally.</p>

    <h3>Draft</h3>
    <p>I started to work on the cafe’s logo and wordmark after decided its topic and name. Using an hourglass as a symbol of time came to mind naturally, and I settled on the idea of indicating a transition from digital to physical by mixing pixel with concrete
      lines.</p>

    <h3>Wordmark</h3>
    <p>The wordmark, however, takes quite awhile. I tested many typefaces and used all sorts of ways to mix types and combine the words to make something interesting and meaningful.</p>

    <h3>PATTERN</h3>
    <p>Since the cafe is a critique, I chose broken glass as the pattern for the system. I got some glass screen shields, broke them and photographed(sometimes scanned) those pieces in various ways. Glass as a material is used throughout the identity system.

    <h3>ICONS</h3>
    <p>
      I have a clear idea of having the icons on the cafe’s website, so most of the icons are straightforward.

    <h3>WIREFRAME</h3>
    <p>
      The cafe’s website is a main component of its service. It’s a platform where people can access data be collected during their stay at the cafe, and allows them to edit and store the data. It reveals the data collection happened without one’s awareness
      as well as points out the unreliability of the source.

    <h3>LOGOMARK &amp; STYLE GUIDE</h3>
    <p>This is a minimal style guide showing only the type choices and palette. The color is less of a concern in this system, for the materiality of glass is emphasized.</p>

    <h3>SPACE</h3>
    <p>I want the cafe to have a warm feeling, to create the contrast with the idea of big data. You should feel happy inside the cafe while enjoying the food and drink. Yet in the end, customers will be more aware of the issue as they leave. Designing the
      service in the cafe will have a major role if the project develops.</p>

    <h3>WEBSITE PROTOTYPE</h3>
    <p>To show the icons in context, I built a website prototype. <a href="https://invis.io/9BG9NRGY2GK">Click here</a> to visit the interactive prototype.</p>

    <h3>TABLEWARES</h3>
    <p>
      This is my favorite part of this project. I got to choose the bowls and dishes for the imaginary cafe and I can put the logo and wordmark I made on them. This is a picture of the bowl in use. It becomes my favorite bowl:&#41;
