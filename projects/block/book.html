<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> I left my home and couldn’t get back, for I forgot which house was mine. // narrative

These two books were made to tell a fictional story about an existing block. The goal is to recreate the mysterious atmosphere of the neighborhood.
I chose a block in Upper Rockridge area in Oakland, which is close to where I lived. The block is mainly a residential area, with a church and a musical school. I had passed by this block couple of times and was intrigued by its atmosphere. The goal of this project is to recreate the feeling I had about this block.</textarea>

<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> EXPLORATION

In order to get content, I went through some exercises &#40;including generating a palette and studying typography on the block&#41;. The observation exercise, staying on the block for an hour and write down anything comes to mind, is particularly interesting to me. I repeated the exercise several times and used the writing in the book.</textarea>

<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> STORY

As the title says, 'I left my home and couldn’t get back, for I forgot which house was mine', is the start of the story. He goes out, tries all kinds of ways to remind himself but keeps failing. The other character lost something on the block. They are trapped on the same block.

<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> PHOTOGRAPHY

Taking a good photo is hard. At the beginning of this project, I have little knowledge on photography. Then I started to read about photography and practice on my own. Luckily, I managed to get some nice images to work with. All the photos included in the books are taken on/around the block. They are meant to be ambiguous in meaning.

<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> TYPOGRAPHY

Two typefaces are used in these books, Adobe Garamond and Cooper Hewitt. I choose Garamond because it is beautiful and classic; Cooper Hewitt because of its academic characteristic and how different it is from Garamond. Each typeface is the voice, even identity, of one of the two characters in the story.</textarea>

<textarea onclick="textAreaAdjust(this)">-> THE BOOKS

I’m always interested in the way people interpret and relate things. It’s our nature to create a narrative so that we can remember better. The separation of text and images is an encouragement for the audience to build their own narrative about the block.
My very first mockup is one book with both text and pictures. It’s a French fold binding with all the images sealed into the spine so that the readers have limited access to the pictures.
