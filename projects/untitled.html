  <p>The viewer’s location is tracked by a depth sensor, and visuals are generated and projected on the ground, merging into the viewer’s own shadow. The visuals are programmed in Processing, using a physics engine library.</p>

    <h3>proposal</h3>
    <p>This is a half-semester long project. Final installation is shown in the interface show at the end of the semester. The work sheet helps me to plan ahead and keep orginized.</p>

    <h3>experiments</h3>
    <p>The project invovles using physics libray, kinnect sensor, and working with computer vision, which were new to me. I make small sketches to test the algrithums and eventually managed put everything toghether.</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>Lots of unexpected things happened during the setup. A lot of code adjustments. The size is quite limited because of the space(height of the wall determines size of the projection). Overall it's a good experience and practice. Here is a short video showing it working</p>
