      This site is a collection of works I made during past two years.
      In 2018, I joined the curation team at <a href="">Baoku Jiangxin Art Center</a> as visual designer.
      Summer 2019, I created visual identiies for Slush Shenzhen & Shanghai 2019.
      In fall, I joined ZILLIZ, a startup developing database for the AI Industry.
