    <p>Hi! I'm Erin Zhang (feel free to call me Yunying if that's easier for you), a visual designer / creative developer based in San Francisco.
      As a designer, I build identity systems, websites, visualizations and interfaces.
      I make random installations and experiments with code.
      Deeply interested in science and technology, I want to create design that translates abstract and complex ideas to things comprehensive and engaging.</p>
